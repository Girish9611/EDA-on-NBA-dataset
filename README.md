When i was exposed to the field of analytics, my perspective towards watching sports completely changed. I could better understand the reasons for different decision making that takes place when a team is preparing for a league game. To better understand how the field of anayltics and sports merge together, i performed basic exploratory data analysis on a publicly available NBA dataset. While this EDA project does not no go into the depths of understanding the importance of analytics in sports, it does however shed some light on how python can be used to gather relevant information from big datasets. In this project i have used the packages numpy, pandas, matplotlib for printing out the required outputs.
